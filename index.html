    <h2 id="about">About</h2>
    <p>Recycling is a very important topic in today's society, and its significance cannot be overstated. It plays a crucial role in protecting the Earth from the harmful effects of pollution and waste. 
        Every item that we recycle reduces the amount of trash that ends up in landfills or oceans, helping to keep our environment cleaner and healthier.
        By recycling, we can conserve precious natural resources, reduce the need for raw materials, and cut down on energy consumption. We all have the power to make a difference, and by taking the extra step to recycle every day, we contribute to a more sustainable future. 
        Even small actions, when practiced by many, can lead to significant positive change for the planet and all living creatures who call it home.

    <h3>This affects us all!</h3>
        <p>People around the world will feel the effects of the lack of recycling. When recycling is not done, trash one creates is sent to landfills.
            These landfills create harmful emissions, which hurts the atmosphere, and in turn hurts us as humans. Animals were also be affected as well.
            These emissions will harm their habitats in nature and they will eventually be destroyed. Overall, Without recycling, the world will run out of finite resources.

    <h3>We can all do more!</h3>
    <p>Out of all the tons of trash being generated, not all of it ends up in landfills. While recycling helps, we can do more to reduce the amount of waste being produced in the first place. 
        We should aim to minimize waste by making conscious choices in our daily lives. One of the most effective steps we can take is to use reusable items whenever possible‚Äîwhether it's a water bottle, shopping bags, or food containers. 
        By choosing reusable products over single-use plastics, we reduce our reliance on disposable items and decrease the demand for new resources. Small changes in our habits can add up to a significant impact on reducing waste and protecting the environment.
